# Abstract Geometric Shape Creator 🖌️

A Java application for creating and managing geometric shapes, supporting **Point**, **Circle**, **Line Segment**, and **Rectangle**. Each shape implements a **CollisionDetector** interface to check for strict intersections between shapes. The project includes **JUnit** tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

  - **Point**
  - **Circle**
  - **Line Segment**
  - **Rectangle**
- **Collision Detection**:
  - Shapes can detect **strict intersections** with other shapes using the `CollisionDetector` interface.
- **Modular Design**:
  - Object-Oriented Programming principles for extendable and maintainable code.
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Comprehensive test coverage using **JUnit**.
- **Gradle Support**:
  - Build automation and dependency management with Gradle.
